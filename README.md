# Overview
The model predicts the given image into its appropriate dog breed.

The model also classifies between Human or not Human and matches the human to similar kind of Dog breed like this :\
`Hello, Human!
You look like a...
Bloodhound`

The model uses **VGG16** architecture as the **Transfer Learning** process.
